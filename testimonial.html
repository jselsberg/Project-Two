      <p class="testp">"I volunteered as a basketball coach four semesters during my time at Wash U. I can honestly say that it has consistently been the highlight of every week I have participated. 
      <br><br>It is just as rewarding to see the younger kids fall in love with the game as it is to teach older kids some of the nuances of basketball, such as pick-and-rolls, the zone defense, and boxing out. On top of it all, game days are a blast! I get very into every game."</p>

      <p class="testp">"I've been involved in youth sports with the St. Louis YMCA every semester so far at Wash U and am completely in love with it. I've coached soccer, volleyball, and flag football and each one has been a ton of fun. 
      <br><br>I've enjoyed co-coaching with girls in my sorority as a way to bond. I have a busy schedule, so its great that coaching only involves an hour of practice and one game per week and isn't a huge commitment. Koaches 4 Kids has truly made me feel like a part of the St. Louis community. Plus, the kids are so cute and so fun to be around!"</p>
